\usage{
get_nasal_state(read_flowsheets)
}
\arguments{
\item{read_flowsheets}{the raw flowsheet csv file obtained from the IDR}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing the substitute FiO2 values
}
\description{
Creates a substitute fio2 based on nasal flow rate
\itemize{
\item low flow states (≤2L) will likely be using variable oxygen concentrations from the
wall but will most likely have low relative oxygen delivery because of low flow rates.
Because the relative FiO2 delivered is low no matter what FiO2 value is charted,
the resultant SpO2/FiO2 ratios would be very high and preclude a resp score of > 0.
So instances where the flow rate is ≤2L/min can be designated as a resp score of “0”
in that hour without the need to calculate the SpO2/FiO2 ratio.

\item for mid-flow states of nasal cannula and high-flow nasal cannula (>2L and <6L) there
are two reasonable options. One option is that if there is an FiO2 charted within the hour
with these flow rates, that FiO2 is used for SpO2/FiO2 calculations.
If an FiO2 is not charted in that hour we assume it is 1.0 for calculations.

\item sets the respiratory status to false at all timepoints
